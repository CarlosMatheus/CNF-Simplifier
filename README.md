# CNF-Simplifier
Conjunctive Normal Form expression simplifier that preserves satisfiability

## Usage

Run `main.py`, you can also change some numeric parameters inside `main.py`.

```
python3 main.py
```

`main.py` will generate inputs folders with input files on DIMACS format, it will then read and simplify each one putting then into outputs folder.

The metrics of the simplifications will be stored on a file called `results.txt`.
